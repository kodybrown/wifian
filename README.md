wifian
======

A simple WiFi signal strength analyzer (CLI-based).
It should be pretty straight forward.

I was looking for a super fast and simple to use signal analyzer and didn't
find one I liked. All I wanted was something to show me directional signal 
strength and quality. Pretty simple, but I couldn't find what I wanted. So
here is my version.
